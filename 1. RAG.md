# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

### 1. What is RAG ?
**Ans:** **RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation**. It’s a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) where a model combines both retrieval-based and generative approaches to generate more accurate and informative responses.

Here’s how it works:

**Retrieval**: First, the model retrieves relevant information or documents from a large corpus, usually based on the input query.
**Augmentation**: Then, it uses this retrieved data to augment or inform the generation process.
**Generation**: Finally, the model generates a response, often using the retrieved information, ensuring the response is both relevant and contextually correct.
RAG is useful because it can help models provide more specific and fact-based answers, especially for tasks where the model might not have all the knowledge internally (e.g., specific data points, up-to-date events, etc.).

It’s often used in more advanced AI applications, like conversational agents, question-answering systems, and any context where accurate, contextually aware responses are needed.
